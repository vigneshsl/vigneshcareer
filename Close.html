        <h2>⚙️ What It Does</h2>
        <p>When launched, this tool checks for all currently active applications and background processes. It sends a force stop signal to each one, including any helper or sub-processes that were launched with them.</p>
        <p>A short delay is added after execution to allow all processes to shut down properly before anything else continues.</p>
